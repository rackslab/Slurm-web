== Components

This diagram represents all Slurm-web components with their respective roles and
integration with Slurm workload manager:

Slurm-web is based on 3 components:

* *agent*: Sends requests to Slurm `slurmrestd` service which exposes a REST
  API for `slurmctld` and `slurmdbd` daemons. The _agent_ is also in charge of
  the _authorizations_ enforcement and acts as a _caching_ layer over Slurm.
* *gateway*: Performs _user authentication_ and acts as a _reserve proxy_ for
  the _agents_.
* *frontend*: The _representation layer_ for the user interface. It is actually
  served by the _gateway_ application and executed on client side in web
  browsers.

== Integration

In addition to Slurm workload manager, Slurm-web interacts with some other
external services and data sources:

The *gateway* component authenticates users with an entreprise LDAP
directory. Slurm-web supports all major LDAP services implementation such as
OpenLDAP, FreeIPA and Active Directory with legacy NIS and RFC 2307 bis schemas.

The *agent* component reads the
xref:conf:policy.adoc[RBAC autorization policy] from a plain INI file with
permissions associated to roles and LDAP groups.

Optionally, the *agent* can also:

- Extract cluster racking topology from
  xref:racksdb:overview:start.adoc[RacksDB] database to generate
  xref:overview.adoc#nodes-status[interactive graphical representation of nodes status]
  in the racks.
- Connect to https://redis.io/[Redis] in-memory key/value database to
  xref:overview.adoc#cache[save cached data] from Slurm.
- Integrate with https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] (or compatible) by exporting
  xref:overview.adoc#metrics[various Slurm metrics] for storage in timeseries
  database. The agent can then query this database to get historical values of
  these metrics.

[#protocols]
== Protocols

Protocols and authentication realms involved in communications between Slurm-web
and Slurm components are represented in this diagram:

.Protocols in communication between Slurm-web components [xref:image$arch/slurm-web_protocols.svg[icon:download[] SVG]]
image::arch/slurm-web_protocols.png[]

All communications from the clients web browsers to Slurm-web *agent*
component are performed with HTTP over TCP/IP network protocols. These
network communications can be secured with SSL/TLS (aka. HTTPS) over standard
port TCP/443 with a xref:conf:wsgi/index.adoc[production HTTP server]. After
initial authentication with LDAP directory, users are authenticated between
these components with https://jwt.io/[JSON Web Token] (JWT). Slurm-web has its
own JWT realm, with its dedicated JWT signing key, to secure communication
between its components.

Slurm `slurmrestd` supports incoming HTTP requests on:

* *Unix socket*, with two authentication methods: `rest_auth/local`, in which
  `slurmrestd` authenticates users with client process UID/GID, and
  `rest_auth/jwt` with tokens signed by Slurm JWT signing key.
* *TCP/IP socket*, with `rest_auth/jwt` authentication supported only.

Slurm-web *agent* supports all these combinations of sockets and authentication
methods. Please refer to
xref:conf:slurmrestd.adoc[slurmrestd access configuration page] for more
details.

Slurm components communicates with specific binary RPC protocol over TCP/IP
sockets, secured by either https://dun.github.io/munge/[Munge] or
https://slurm.schedmd.com/authentication.html#slurm[Slurm internal mechanism].
When JWT authentication is used between Slurm-web *agent* and Slurm `slurmrestd`
service, the `auth/jwt` alternative authentication type must also be enabled in
main Slurm and `slurmdbd` configuration.

[#multiclusters]
== Multi-clusters Distribution

Slurm-web is designed to support natively multiple HPC clusters with a central
dashboard. In this configuration, the components are distributed as represented
in this diagram:

.Slurm-web distribution on multiple clusters [xref:image$arch/slurm-web_distribution.svg[icon:download[] SVG]]
image::arch/slurm-web_distribution.png[]

In this configuration, the *agent* component must be deployed on all clusters
collocated with Slurm `slurmrestd` daemon. An *agent* interacts with only one
Slurm cluster.

The *gateway* can be installed on a central server. It distributes the requests
to the *agents* deployed on the clusters.

[#slurm-versions]
== Slurm REST API versions

Slurm-web {version} is officially tested and supported with Slurm REST API
*v{api_version}*. This version of Slurm REST API is available in Slurm 23.11,
24.05 and 24.11.

This table represents all Slurm REST API versions supported by the latest Slurm
releases:
