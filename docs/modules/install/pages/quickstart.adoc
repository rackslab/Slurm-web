== Setup `slurmrestd`

Create [.path]#`/etc/systemd/system/slurmrestd.service.d/slurm-web.conf`#
drop-in configuration override for `slurmrestd` service:

[source,ini]
----
[Service]
# Unset vendor unit ExecStart to avoid cumulative definition
ExecStart=
Environment=
# Disable slurm user security check
Environment=SLURMRESTD_SECURITY=disable_user_check
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/slurmrestd $SLURMRESTD_OPTIONS -a rest_auth/local unix:/run/slurmrestd/slurmrestd.socket
RuntimeDirectory=slurmrestd
RuntimeDirectoryMode=0755
User=slurm
Group=slurm
----

NOTE: With this configuration, `slurmrestd` listens for incoming connections on
Unix socket with _local_ authentication method. It is also possible to configure
`slurmrestd` to listen on TCP/IP with JWT authentication, please refer to
xref:conf:slurmrestd.adoc[`slurmrestd` configuration page] for more details.

Make `systemd` reload units changes on disk:

== Initial setup

Create _agent_ configuration file [.path]#`/etc/slurm-web/agent.ini`# to set the
cluster name, for example:

[source,ini]
----
[service]
cluster=atlas
----

Create _gateway_ configuration file [.path]#`/etc/slurm-web/gateway.ini`# with
URL to the _agent_:

[source,ini]
----
[agents]
url=http://localhost:5012
----

NOTE: By default, Slurm-web agent listens on port TCP/5012 of loopback network
interface. This can be changed with `port` parameter in
xref:conf:conf/agent.adoc#_service[`service` section of agent configuration].

== JWT signing key

Slurm-web authenticates users with https://jwt.io/[JSON Web Token] (JWT) for
communications between its components. A secret key is required to
cryptographically sign generated tokens. Run this command to generate this key:

[source,console]
----
# /usr/libexec/slurm-web/slurm-web-gen-jwt-key
INFO ⸬ Running slurm-web-gen-jwt-key
INFO ⸬ Generating JWT private key file /var/lib/slurm-web/jwt.key
INFO ⸬ Setting read permission on key for slurm-web user
INFO ⸬ Setting read permission on key for slurm user

* xref:usage:manpages/slurm-web-gen-jwt-key.adoc[`slurm-web-gen-jwt-key` command manpage]
--

== First Access

Slurm-web is now ready to start! Enable and start the _agent_ and _gateway_
native services:

[source,console]
----
# systemctl enable --now slurm-web-agent.service
# systemctl enable --now slurm-web-gateway.service
----

Connect your browser to the _gateway_ on http://localhost:5011. You should see
the configured cluster:

image:slurm-web_clusters.png[]

[NOTE]
====
By default, Slurm-web gateway native service listens for incoming network
connections on port TCP/5011. This can be changed with `port` parameter in
xref:conf:conf/gateway.adoc#_service[`service` section of gateway configuration].

Also, the gateway native service is binded to loopback network interface by
default. It restricts access to localhost for security reason. It is recommended
to setup <<#production,production HTTP server>> for external access to
Slurm-web. However, this can be changed anyway with the following lines in
_gateway_ configuration file [.path]#`/etc/slurm-web/gateway.ini`#:

[source,ini]
----
[service]
interface=HOSTNAME_OR_IP

[ui]
host=http://HOSTNAME_OR_IP:5011
----

Real values depend on the DNS hostname or the public IP address of the host.

Slurm-web is now be available on: http://HOSTNAME_OR_IP:5011

Please refer to
xref:conf:conf/gateway.adoc[gateway configuration reference documentation] for
more details.
====

TIP: In case of failure, please refer to
xref:misc:troubleshooting.adoc#native[troubleshooting guide] for help.

.More details
****
* xref:conf:conf/gateway.adoc[Gateway configuration reference documentation]

== Setup authentication

To restrict access to the dashboard, you must enable authentication. Slurm-web
supports LDAP authentication.

Add the following settings in the _gateway_ configuration file
[.path]#`/etc/slurm-web/gateway.ini`#:

[source,ini]
----
[authentication]
enabled=yes

[ldap]
uri=ldap://SERVER
user_base=ou=PEOPLE,dc=EXAMPLE,dc=TLD
group_base=ou=GROUPS,dc=EXAMPLE,dc=TLD
----

`SERVER`, user and groups search bases must be adapted to match your LDAP server
and directory tree.

[NOTE]
====
Slurm-web also supports LDAPS (SSL/TLS) and STARTTLS secured protocols with LDAP
servers.

The groups of users permitted to authenticate on Slurm-web can also be
restricted with `restricted_groups` parameter.

Please refer to reference documentation of
xref:conf:conf/gateway.adoc#_ldap[`ldap` section in gateway configuration] for
more details.
====

Restart _gateway_ service to apply the new configuration:

[source,console]
----
# systemctl restart slurm-web-gateway.service
----

The authentication form is now presented on Slurm-web access:

image:slurm-web_login.png[]

Upon successfull LDAP authentication, users have access to the clusters.

TIP: Any problem to setup LDAP authentication?
xref:usage:manpages/slurm-web-ldap-check.adoc[`slurm-web-ldap-check`] utility
might help. More details in xref:misc:troubleshooting.adoc#ldap[Troubleshooting
page].

.More details
****
* xref:conf:conf/gateway.adoc[Gateway configuration reference documentation]
****

[#policy]
== Setup policy

At this stage, the _agent_ is running with default authorization policy. You can
create a file [.path]#`/etc/slurm-web/policy.ini`# to define your custom RBAC
fine-grain policy with specific roles.

Consider this example:

[source,ini]
----
[roles]
user=@biology
admin=jwalls

[user]
actions=view-stats,view-jobs,view-nodes

[admin]
actions=view-partitions,view-qos,view-accounts,view-reservations
----

This policy defines *two roles*:

* *user* for members of _biology_ group. This role has permission on
  `view-stats`, `view-jobs` and `view-nodes` actions.
* *admin* for _jwalls_ user. This role has permission on `view-partitions`,
  `view-qos`,`view-accounts` and `view-reservations` actions.

NOTE: Please refer to
xref:conf:policy.adoc#actions[Authorization policy reference documentation] for
description of all available actions and the corresponding permissions granted
in user interface.

Restart the _agent_ component to apply the new configuration:

[source,console]
----
# systemctl restart slurm-web-agent.service
----

User _jwalls_ who is also member of _biology_ group is granted both _user_ and
_admin_ roles, she has access to everything:

image:slurm-web_policy_admin.png[]

Another user in _biology_ group can only view jobs and resources:

image:slurm-web_policy_user.png[]

Access to the cluster is denied to all other users:

image:slurm-web_policy_others.png[]

.More details
****
* xref:conf:policy.adoc[Authorization policy reference documentation]
****

[#cache]
== Setup cache

Slurm-web has a xref:overview:overview.adoc#cache[transparent caching feature]
which can use https://redis.io/[Redis] (or any compatible alternative) in-memory
database to cache Slurm responses.

IMPORTANT: It is highly recommended to setup cache on Slurm-web agent to
significantly reduce the amount of repetitive requests sent to Slurm and reduce
its load.

Install Redis:

[tabs]
======
APT::
+
====
For https://debian.org/[Debian] and https://ubuntu.com/[Ubuntu], run this
command:

[source,console]
----
# apt install redis-server
----
====

DNF::
+
====
For
https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux[RHEL],
https://www.centos.org/[CentOS],
https://rockylinux.org/[Rocky Linux] and
https://almalinux.org/[AlmaLinux OS], run this command:

[source,console]
----
# dnf install redis
----

Start and enable the service:

[source,console]
----
# systemctl enable --now redis.service
----
====
======

Edit _agent_ configuration file [.path]#`/etc/slurm-web/agent.ini`# to enable
cache:

[source,ini]
----
[cache]
enabled=yes
----

NOTE: It is also possible to setup a remote Redis server, configure a password
to access a server secured in protected mode or adjust cache timeouts. More
details in
xref:conf:conf/agent.adoc#_cache[`cache` section of agent configuration file].

.More details
****
* xref:conf:conf/agent.adoc[Agent configuration reference documentation]
****

[#production]
== Production HTTP server

At this stage, Slurm-web is served by a Python HTTP server which is not designed
for production requirements. The performances are not optimal and network
communications are not secured with SSL/TLS certificate. This setup is not
recommended for production. It is recommended to setup a production HTTP server
such as Nginx, Apache or Caddy to launch Slurm-web as a WSGI application.

NOTE: For simplicity reason, this quickstart guide gives only the procedure to
setup Nginx but documentation is available for
xref:conf:wsgi/index.adoc[other supported HTTP servers].

Stop and disable Slurm-web native services:

[source,console]
----
# systemctl disable --now slurm-web-agent.service slurm-web-gateway.service
----

Edit _gateway_ configuration file [.path]#`/etc/slurm-web/gateway.ini`#:

[source,ini]
----
[ui]
host=http://DNS_HOSTNAME

[agents]
url=http://localhost/agent
----

Real values depend on the DNS hostname of the host.

TIP: The `[service]` section can be safely removed now as it is ignored when
Slurm-web is launched as WSGI applications.

include::conf:partial$uwsgi-services.adoc[]

Edit Nginx site configuration to add these locations:

[source]
----
server {
  …

  location / {
    include uwsgi_params;
    uwsgi_pass unix:/run/slurm-web-gateway/uwsgi.sock;
  }

  location /agent/ {
    include uwsgi_params;
    rewrite ^/agent/(.*)$ /$1 break;
    uwsgi_pass unix:/run/slurm-web-agent/uwsgi.sock;
  }
}
----

Reload Nginx to apply new configuration:

[source,console]
----
# systemctl reload nginx.service
----

Slurm-web is now available at: http://DNS_HOSTNAME/

In case of failure, please refer to
xref:misc:troubleshooting.adoc#wsgi[troubleshooting guide] for help.

[#racksdb]
== RacksDB database (optional)

Slurm-web can use xref:racksdb:overview:start.adoc[RacksDB] to generate
xref:overview:overview.adoc#nodes-status[advanced interactive graphical representations]
of datacenters racks with the compute nodes. For this feature, RacksDB database
must be defined with your HPC cluster infrastructure. This is actually quick and
easy easy based on
xref:racksdb:install:quickstart.adoc#examples[the examples provided].

Some requirements must be fulfilled in this database:

* The infrastructure must have the same name as the cluster
  <<_initial_setup,previously declared>> in _agent_ configuration file.
* The _compute_ tag must be assigned to all compute nodes declared in Slurm
  configuration.

[NOTE]
====
You can choose other tag name but you will have to declare this tag in
xref:conf:conf/agent.adoc#_racksdb[`racksdb` section of agent configuration],
for example:

[source,ini]
----
[racksdb]
tags=blade
----
====

[NOTE]
====
If you don't need this
xref:overview:overview.adoc#nodes-status[advanced interactive graphical representations]
feature, RacksDB integration can be completely disabled with the following lines
in [.path]#`/etc/slurm-web/agent.ini`#:

[source,ini]
----
[racksdb]
enabled=no
----
====

--

== Metrics (optional)

Slurm-web offers the possibility to
xref:overview:overview.adoc#metrics[export Slurm metrics] in
https://openmetrics.io/[OpenMetrics] format and integrate with
https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus]. This feature can be used to store metrics in
timeseries databases and draw diagrams of historical data.

This feature is disabled by default. It can be enabled with the following lines
in [.path]#`/etc/slurm-web/agent.ini`#:

[source,ini]
----
[metrics]
enabled=yes
----

.More details
****
* xref:conf:metrics.adoc[Metrics export configuration documentation].
****

== Multi-clusters

Slurm-web is designed to support
xref:overview:architecture.adoc#multiclusters[distributed setup] with a central
server and multiple clusters. Compared to the steps above, the following changes
must be considered:

. <<#slurmrestd,Install and setup `slurmrestd`>> on all clusters.
. Install `Slurm-web` agent on all clusters, colocated on the same hosts as
  `slurmrestd`.
. Install `Slurm-web` gateway on the central server.
. Setup xref:conf:wsgi/index.adoc[production HTTP servers] with HTTPS (SSL/TLS)
  for all agents and the gateway.
. Set URL of all agents in
  xref:conf:conf/gateway.adoc#_agents[`agents` section of gateway configuration].
. Generate JWT signing key on central server and deploy this key on all agents
  servers (same key must be shared by all agents and the gateway).
. Deploy <<#racksdb,RacksDB database>> on all agents servers.
. Deploy <<#policy,custom policy>> on all agents servers.
. <<#cache,Install Redis>> on all agents servers.

Et voilà!
