Slurm-web extracts Slurm information from the REST API provided its `slurmrestd`
daemon. This daemon must be installed on the host. The installation method
depends on the origin of Slurm packages deployed on the cluster:

[tabs]
======
SchedMD RPM packages::
+
====
On clusters deployed with SchedMD official RPM packages, install `slurmrestd`
daemon with this command:

[source,console]
----
# dnf install slurm-slurmrestd
----

TIP: Please refer to {slurm-install-guide}[SchedMD official Slurm installation
guide] for more help.
====

EPEL::
+
====
On clusters deployed with RPM packages from {epel}[EPEL community],
install `slurmrestd` daemon with this command:

[source,console]
----
# dnf install slurm-slurmrestd
----
====

SchedMD Deb packages::
+
====
On clusters deployed with SchedMD official Deb packages, install `slurmrestd`
daemon with this command:

[source,console]
----
# apt install slurm-smd-slurmrestd
----

TIP: Please refer to {slurm-install-guide}[SchedMD official Slurm installation
guide] for more help.

Debian::
+
====
On clusters deployed with RPM packages from {debian}[Debian community], install
`slurmrestd` with this command:

[source,console]
----
# apt install slurmrestd
----
====
======

== Setup `slurmrestd`

Create [.path]#`/etc/systemd/system/slurmrestd.service.d/slurm-web.conf`#
drop-in configuration override for `slurmrestd` daemon:

[source,ini]
----
[Service]
# Unset vendor unit ExecStart to avoid cumulative definition
ExecStart=
Environment=
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/slurmrestd $SLURMRESTD_OPTIONS unix:/run/slurmrestd/slurmrestd.socket
RuntimeDirectory=slurmrestd
RuntimeDirectoryMode=0755
User=slurm
Group=slurm
----

NOTE: This configuration file makes `slurmrestd` listen for incoming connections
on Unix socket accessible by Slurm-web.

Make `systemd` reload units changes on disk:

[source,console]
----
# systemctl daemon-reload
----

Enable and start `slurmrestd` service:

[source,console]
----
# systemctl enable --now slurmrest.service
----

To check `slurmrestd` daemon is properly running, run this command:

[source,console]
----
# curl --unix-socket /run/slurmrestd/slurmrestd.socket http:/slurm/slurm/v0.0.39/diag
{
   "meta": {

== JWT signing key

Slurm-web authenticates users with https://jwt.io/[JSON Web Token] (JWT) for
communications between its components. A secret key is required to
cryptographically sign generated tokens. Run this command to generate this key:

[source,console]
----
# /usr/libexec/slurm-web/slurm-web-gen-jwt-key
INFO ⸬ Running slurm-web-gen-jwt-key
INFO ⸬ Generating JWT private key file /var/lib/slurm-web/jwt.key
INFO ⸬ Setting read permission on key for slurm-web user
INFO ⸬ Setting read permission on key for slurm user

* xref:usage:manpages/slurm-web-gen-jwt-key.adoc[`slurm-web-gen-jwt-key` command manpage]
--

== Initial setup

Create _agent_ configuration file [.path]#`/etc/slurm-web/agent.ini`# to set the
cluster name, for example:

[source,ini]
----
[service]
cluster=atlas
----

Create _gateway_ configuration file [.path]#`/etc/slurm-web/gateway.ini`# with
URL to the _agent_:

[source,ini]
----
[agents]
url=http://localhost:5012
----

NOTE: By default, Slurm-web agent listens on port TCP/5012 of loopback network
interface. This can be changed with `port` parameter in
xref:conf:conf/agent.adoc#_service[`service` section of agent configuration].

[#racksdb]
== RacksDB database

Slurm-web uses xref:racksdb:overview:start.adoc[RacksDB] to generate graphical
representation of datacenters racks with the compute nodes. RacksDB database
must be defined with your HPC cluster infrastructure. This is actually quick and
easy easy based on
xref:racksdb:install:quickstart.adoc#examples[the examples provided].

Some requirements must be fulfilled in this database:

* The infrastructure must have the same name as the cluster
  <<_initial_setup,previously declared>> in _agent_ configuration file.
* The _compute_ tag must be assigned to all compute nodes declared in Slurm
  configuration.

[NOTE]
====
You can choose other tag name but you will have to declare this tag in
xref:conf:conf/agent.adoc#_racksdb[`racksdb` section of agent configuration],
for example:

[source,ini]
----
[racksdb]
tags=blade
----
====

[sidebar]

* xref:racksdb:overview:start.adoc[RacksDB reference documentation]
* xref:racksdb:install:quickstart.adoc[RacksDB quickstart guide]
* xref:racksdb:db:structure.adoc[RacksDB database structure reference]
--

== First Access

Slurm-web is now ready to start! Enable and start the _agent_ and _gateway_
native services:

[source,console]
----
# systemctl enable --now slurm-web-agent.service
# systemctl enable --now slurm-web-gateway.service
----

Connect your browser to the _gateway_ on http://localhost:5011. You should see
the configured cluster:

image:slurm-web_clusters.png[]

[NOTE]
====
By default, Slurm-web gateway native service listens for incoming network
connections on port TCP/5011. This can be changed with `port` parameter in
xref:conf:conf/gateway.adoc#_service[`service` section of gateway configuration].

Also, the gateway native service is binded to loopback network interface by
default. It restricts access to localhost for security reason. It is recommended
to setup <<#production,production HTTP server>> for external access to
Slurm-web. However, this can be changed anyway with the following lines in
_gateway_ configuration file [.path]#`/etc/slurm-web/gateway.ini`#:

[source,ini]
----
[service]
interface=HOSTNAME_OR_IP

[ui]
host=http://HOSTNAME_OR_IP:5011
----

Real values depend on the DNS hostname or the public IP address of the host.

Slurm-web is now be available on: http://HOSTNAME_OR_IP:5011

Please refer to
xref:conf:conf/gateway.adoc[gateway configuration reference documentation] for
more details.

TIP: In case of failure, please refer to
xref:misc:troubleshooting.adoc#native[troubleshooting guide] for help.

== Setup authentication

To restrict access to the dashboard, you must enable authentication. Slurm-web
supports LDAP authentication.

Add the following settings in the _gateway_ configuration file
[.path]#`/etc/slurm-web/gateway.conf`#:

[source,ini]
----
[authentication]
enabled=yes

[ldap]
uri=ldap://SERVER
user_base=ou=PEOPLE,dc=EXAMPLE,dc=TLD
group_base=ou=GROUPS,dc=EXAMPLE,dc=TLD
----

`SERVER`, user and groups search bases must be adapted to match your LDAP server
and directory tree.

[NOTE]
====
Slurm-web also supports LDAPS (SSL/TLS) and STARTTLS secured protocols with LDAP
servers.

The groups of users permitted to authenticate on Slurm-web can also be
restricted with `restricted_groups` parameter.

Please refer to reference documentation of
xref:conf:conf/gateway.adoc#_ldap[`ldap` section in gateway configuration] for
more details.
====

Restart _gateway_ service to apply the new configuration:

[source,console]
----
# systemctl restart slurm-web-gateway.service
----

The authentication form is now presented on Slurm-web access:

image:slurm-web_login.png[]

Upon successfull LDAP authentication, users have access to the clusters.

TIP: Any problem to setup LDAP authentication?
xref:usage:manpages/slurm-web-ldap-check.adoc[`slurm-web-ldap-check`] utility
might help. More details in xref:misc:troubleshooting.adoc#ldap[Troubleshooting
page].

.More details
****
* xref:conf:conf/gateway.adoc[Gateway configuration reference documentation]
****

[#policy]
== Setup policy

At this stage, the _agent_ is running with default authorization policy. You can
create a file [.path]#`/etc/slurm-web/policy.ini`# to define your custom RBAC
fine-grain policy with specific roles.

Consider this example:

[source,ini]
----
[roles]
user=@biology
admin=jwalls

[user]
actions=view-stats,view-jobs,view-nodes

[admin]
actions=view-partitions,view-qos,view-accounts,view-reservations
----

This policy defines *two roles*:

* *user* for members of _biology_ group. This role has permission on
  `view-stats`, `view-jobs` and `view-nodes` actions.
* *admin* for _jwalls_ user. This role has permission on `view-partitions`,
  `view-qos`,`view-accounts` and `view-reservations` actions.

NOTE: Please refer to
xref:conf:policy.adoc#actions[Authorization policy reference documentation] for
description of all available actions and the corresponding permissions granted
in user interface.

Restart the _agent_ component to apply the new configuration:

[source,console]
----
# systemctl restart slurm-web-agent.service
----

User _jwalls_ who is also member of _biology_ group is granted both _user_ and
_admin_ roles, she has access to everything:

image:slurm-web_policy_admin.png[]

Another user in _biology_ group can only view jobs and resources:

image:slurm-web_policy_user.png[]

Access to the cluster is denied to all other users:

image:slurm-web_policy_others.png[]

.More details
****
* xref:conf:policy.adoc[Authorization policy reference documentation]
****

[#cache]
== Setup cache

Slurm-web has a xref:overview:overview.adoc#cache[transparent caching feature]
which can use https://redis.io/[Redis] (or any compatible alternative) in-memory
database to cache Slurm responses.

IMPORTANT: It is highly recommended to setup cache on Slurm-web agent to
significantly reduce the amount of repetitive requests sent to Slurm and reduce
its load.

Install Redis:

[tabs]
======
APT::
+
====
For https://debian.org/[Debian] and https://ubuntu.com/[Ubuntu], run this
command:

[source,console]
----
# apt install redis-server
----
====

DNF::
+
====
For
https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux[RHEL],
https://www.centos.org/[CentOS],
https://rockylinux.org/[Rocky Linux] and
https://almalinux.org/[AlmaLinux OS], run this command:

[source,console]
----
# dnf install redis
----

Start and enable the service:

[source,console]
----
# systemctl enable --now redis.service
----
====
======

Edit _agent_ configuration file [.path]#`/etc/slurm-web/agent.ini`# to enable
cache:

[source,ini]
----
[cache]
enabled=yes
----

NOTE: It is also possible to setup a remote Redis server, configure a password
to access a server secured in protected mode or adjust cache timeouts. More
details in
xref:conf:conf/agent.adoc#_cache[`cache` section of agent configuration file].

.More details
****

[#production]
== Production HTTP server

At this stage, Slurm-web is served by a Python HTTP server which is not designed
for production requirements. The performances are not optimal and network
communications are not secured with SSL/TLS certificate. This setup is not
recommended for production. It is recommended to setup a production HTTP server
such as Nginx, Apache or Caddy to launch Slurm-web as a WSGI application.

NOTE: For simplicity reason, this quickstart guide gives only the procedure to
setup Nginx but documentation is available for
xref:conf:wsgi/index.adoc[other supported HTTP servers].

Stop and disable Slurm-web native services:

[source,console]
----
# systemctl disable --now slurm-web-agent.service slurm-web-gateway.service
----

Edit _gateway_ configuration file [.path]#`/etc/slurm-web/gateway.conf`#:

[source,ini]
----
[ui]
host=http://DNS_HOSTNAME

[agents]
url=http://localhost/agent
----

Real values depend on the DNS hostname of the host.

TIP: The `[service]` section can be safely removed now as it is ignored when
Slurm-web is launched as WSGI applications.

include::conf:partial$uwsgi-services.adoc[]

Edit Nginx site configuration to add these locations:

[source]
----
server {
  …

  location / {
    include uwsgi_params;
    uwsgi_pass unix:/run/slurm-web-gateway/uwsgi.sock;
  }

  location /agent/ {
    include uwsgi_params;
    rewrite ^/agent/(.*)$ /$1 break;
    uwsgi_pass unix:/run/slurm-web-agent/uwsgi.sock;
  }
}
----

Reload Nginx to apply new configuration:

[source,console]
----
# systemctl reload nginx.service
----

Slurm-web is now available at: http://DNS_HOSTNAME/

In case of failure, please refer to
xref:misc:troubleshooting.adoc#wsgi[troubleshooting guide] for help.

.More details
****
* xref:conf:wsgi/index.adoc[Production HTTP server setup guide].
****

== Multi-clusters

Slurm-web is designed to support
xref:overview:architecture.adoc#multiclusters[distributed setup] with a central
server and multiple clusters. Compared to the steps above, the following changes
must be considered:

. <<#slurmrestd,Install and setup `slurmrestd`>> on all clusters.
. Install `Slurm-web` agent on all clusters, colocated on the same hosts as
  `slurmrestd`.
. Install `Slurm-web` gateway on the central server.
. Setup xref:conf:wsgi/index.adoc[production HTTP servers] with HTTPS (SSL/TLS)
  for all agents and the gateway.
. Set URL of all agents in
  xref:conf:conf/gateway.adoc#_agents[`agents` section of gateway configuration].
. Generate JWT signing key on central server and deploy this key on all agents
  servers (same key must be shared by all agents and the gateway).
. Deploy <<#racksdb,RacksDB database>> on all agents servers.
. Deploy <<#policy,custom policy>> on all agents servers.
. <<#cache,Install Redis>> on all agents servers.

Et voilà!
