= Production HTTP Server

This sections explains how to setup production HTTP with Slurm-web. Multiple
HTTP servers are supported:

* xref:wsgi/apache.adoc[Apache]
* xref:wsgi/nginx.adoc[Nginx]
* xref:wsgi/caddy.adoc[Caddy]

[IMPORTANT]
====
For simplicity reason and focus on Slurm-web specifics, this documentation
provides configuration snippets to setup HTTP servers with insecure HTTP
protocol without SSL/TLS. Of course, *you MUST setup HTTPS with SSL/TLS on your
production HTTP server* to protect sensible data (passwords, confidential Slurm
information, etc).

There are plenty of methods to setup HTTPS with SSL/TLS certificates, it mostly
depends on your network environment (ex: Let's Encrypt, Internet trusted CA,
enterprise CA, â€¦), so it is not covered in this documentation. Please refer to
official HTTP servers documentation for more help.
====

NOTE: All these examples propose to launch Slurm-web _gateway_ and _agent_ with
https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[uWSGI] because it is stable,
versatible with good performances. There are alternatives though like
https://gunicorn.org/[Gunicorn] or
https://modwsgi.readthedocs.io/en/master/[mod_wsgi]. While documentation is not
provided, Slurm-web should be compatible with these alternatives.

[NOTE]
====
In this documentation, _gateway_ and _agent_ are installed on the same host, in
_mono-cluster mode_. However, Slurm-web supports
xref:overview:architecture.adoc#multiclusters[_multi-clusters mode_] with one
central _gateway_ and multiple _agents_. It is just a matter of:

- Deploying a production HTTP server with only the _agent_ component on all
  clusters,
- Deploying one production HTTP server with only the _gateway_ component on
  central server,
- Settings the _agents_ URL in _gateway_ configuration file.
