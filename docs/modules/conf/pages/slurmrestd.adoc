= Slurmrestd Access

Slurm `slurmrestd` supports incoming HTTP requests on:

* *Unix socket*: In this configuration, Slurm-web agent must be collocated with
`slurmrestd` service on the same host.
* *TCP/IP socket*: HTTP requests can be sent on the network, Slurm-web agent and
`slurmrestd` service can be hosted on separate hosts.

Slurm also supports two authentication methods for `slurmrestd` service:

* *local* (Unix socket only): based on UID/GID of client process.
* *jwt*: based on tokens in HTTP request headers.

WARNING: The *local* authentication method is deprecated because it requires to
run `slurmrestd` as _slurm_ system user which is not supported anymore in Slurm
â‰¥ 25.05. It is recommended to use default *jwt* authentication method.

Slurm-web also supports two tokens management modes for JWT authentication:

* *auto*: Slurm-web agent has access to a copy of Slurm JWT signing key. It
  generates tokens automatically with a short lifespan when required.
* *static*: Token is generated manually by the administrator and set in agent
  configuration. This implies generating tokens with a long lifespan to avoid
  updating the token too often.
