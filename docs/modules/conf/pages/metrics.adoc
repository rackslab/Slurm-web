= Metrics

Slurm-web can be integrated with https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] (or any
compatible solution) to manage Slurm metrics.

image::overview:slurm-web_metrics.png[]

When this feature is enabled, Slurm-web agent exports these metrics in standard
OpenMetrics format on `/metrics` endpoint. This is designed to be collected by
Prometheus (or compatible) in order to store these metrics in timeseries
database. The agent can then query this database, so the frontend can produce
charts with historical values.

This first section explains how to <<start,enable this metrics feature>>. For
security reasons, access to exported metrics can be
<<restrict,restricted to specific hosts>>. Next section explains how to
<<prometheus,configure Prometheus>> to collect Slurm-web metrics. Then
<<query,metrics query settings>> are explained and the last section provides a
<<reference,reference list of all available metrics>>.

[#start]
== Get Started

The metrics feature is disabled by default. It can be enabled with the following
lines in [.path]#`/etc/slurm-web/agent.ini`#:

[source,ini]
----
[metrics]
enabled=yes
----

.More details
****
* xref:conf/agent.adoc#_metrics[Agent configuration metrics section reference documentation].
****

[#restrict]
== Access Restriction

For security reasons, Slurm-web agent restricts access to `/metrics` endpoint to
localhost only. When Prometheus is running on external hosts, you must define
`restrict` parameter in [.path]#`/etc/slurm-web/agent.ini`# to allow other
networks explicitely. For example:

[source,ini]
----
[metrics]
enabled=yes
restrict=
  192.168.1.0/24
  10.0.0.251/32
----

In this example, all IP addresses in range `192.168.1.[0-254]` and `10.0.0.251`
are permitted to request metrics.

[#prometheus]
== Prometheus Integration

Prometheus must be configured to request `/metrics` endpoint of Slurm-web agent.
Edit [.path]#`/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml`# to add one of the following
configuration snippets depending of your setup:

* Slurm-web agent running as native service (ie. with
`slurm-web-agent.service`):

[source,yaml]
----
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: slurm
    scrape_interval: 30s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:5012']
----

* Slurm-web agent running on xref:wsgi/index.adoc[production HTTP server]:

[source,yaml]
----
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: slurm
    scrape_interval: 30s
    metrics_path: /agent/metrics
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:80']
----

NOTE: You may need to adjust the target hostname, typically if Prometheus is
running on a remote host, and destination port (for example 443 for HTTPS).

Check prometheus the scraping job is running properly with this command:

[source,console]
----
$ curl -s http://localhost:9090/api/v1/targets?scrapePool=slurm | jq
----

This command reports the status of the Prometheus scraping job, for example:

[source,json]
----
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "activeTargets": [
      {
        "discoveredLabels": {
          "__address__": "localhost:80",
          "__metrics_path__": "/agent/metrics",
          "__scheme__": "http",
          "__scrape_interval__": "30s",
          "__scrape_timeout__": "10s",
          "job": "slurm"
        },
        "labels": {
          "instance": "localhost:80",
          "job": "slurm"
        },
        "scrapePool": "slurm",
        "scrapeUrl": "http://localhost:80/agent/metrics",
        "globalUrl": "http://localhost:80/agent/metrics",
        "lastError": "", <1>
        "lastScrape": "2024-10-30T12:08:41.494167925+01:00",
        "lastScrapeDuration": 0.107884764,
        "health": "up", <2>
        "scrapeInterval": "30s",
        "scrapeTimeout": "10s"
      }
    ],
    "droppedTargets": []
  }
}
----
<1> `lastError` field must be empty.
<2> `health` must be `up`.

[#query]
== Query Settings

In order to query Prometheus database, Slurm-web must know:

* The *URL* to access Prometheus HTTP API,
* The name of Prometheus *job* that scrapes Slurm-web metrics. This corresponds
  to `job_name` field in [.path]#`/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml`#.

By default, Slurm-web uses `http://localhost:9090` and `slurm` values
respectively. This can be changed with the following settings in
[.path]#`/etc/slurm-web/agent.ini`#, for example:

[source,ini]
----
[metrics]
enabled=yes
host=https://metrics.company.ltd
job=slurmweb
----

.More details
****
