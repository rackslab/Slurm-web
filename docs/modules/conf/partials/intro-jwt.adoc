With _jwt_ authentication method, the client must provide user and token in HTTP
headers. Then, `slurmrestd` service forwards these credentials in RPCs to
`slurmctld` and `slurmdbd` which are responsible to check expiration and
signature of the token.

In this configuration, `slurmrestd` service and Slurm-web *agent* can run with
unprivileged system users.
